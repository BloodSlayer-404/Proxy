### Introduction:
This is an example of the structural design pattern called "Proxy" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example simulates the acces to the Master Sword in the "Leyend of Zelda", letting the Player use it only if it has enough power.

The proxy allows the acces to the Master Sword if the player has the the necesary power, if it don't have the necesary power then the Proxy don't invokes the Master Sword, instead, it returns an advise letting you know that you don't have enough power to use it.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Proxy/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Proxy/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
